# MatchNet

This repository is a `Torch` implementation of the paper [Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08104).
We are looking forward to further improve this network.

Folder description:

1. [train](train): Training the model
2. [visualize](visualize): Visualize the predicted output alongwith different states of the saved model
3. [utils](utils): Contains utility script such as one for preparing dataset for training
